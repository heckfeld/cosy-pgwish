itcl_LW (itcl Lannet Widgets) is a set of itcl widgets. I've written
them a year ago (today is 11/9/1994) while working at Lannet Ltd.,
Israel.  Copyright file is attached (see Widgets/Copyright - it is
basically PD copyrights). The set requires TkPixmap , BLT and itcl
extensions.

./Widgets directory contains the code itself, and ./test - tests 
(what a surprise !).  

	cd test ; ./run.all.tests 

may be interesting.  Tests make use of /usr/local/bin/wish.  

Please don't forget to add Widgets directory to auto_path 
(set auto_path "$auto_path widgets-path/Widgets" ) before using the widgets.

Files are self-documented, no additional documentation (sorry).  All
widgets are visible to `tkinspect' as a regular tk widget.  There is
a primitive support for context-sensitive help (see Widget.itcl),
and a lot of other bells and whistles.  Drag&drop (based on
blt_drag&drop) is attached to Btn2.

I'd be happy if somebody will be using the widgets.

Good luck,
