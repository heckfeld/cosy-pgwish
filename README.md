# cosy-pgwish

pgwish is a project at CoolerSynchrotron Juelich where we developed a complete control system for accelerators

RTOS was the operating system driving the VME Single Board Computer (SBC)

TCL/TK Version 7.3/3.6 was the language for building the Graphical User Interface (GUI) first developed on HP/UX RTE/A systems

THIS project ist to achieve a system, where we do not have to setup complete computers, but only start a series of containers

cosy-pgwish is the container for GUI's
