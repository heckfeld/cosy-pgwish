DESCRIPTION
       The  tixFileSelectbox  command creates a new window (given
       by the pathName argument) and makes it into a  FileSelect-
       box  widget.   Additional options, described above, may be
       specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure  aspects of the FileSelectbox such as its cursor
       and relief.

       Note that the TIX FileSelectbox is a compound  widget.  It
       consists  of  several  sub-widgets.  Some  of  the general
       options used by the sub-widgets,  such  as  background  or
       font,  may  not  be  readily  configured by specifying the
       ?options? arguments. Please refer to the TIX man page  for
       more  details of general configuration of the TIX compound
       widgets.

       The TIX FileSelectbox is similar to the standard Motif(TM)
       file-selection  box. It is generally used to select a file
       to operate on.  It  archives  the  files  mostly  recently
       selected  so  that  they  can be quickly selected again. A
       FileSelectbox is normally packed in a file dialog box. The
       convinence  function tixMkFileDialog will provides a quick
       way of creating such a dialog.  Please read the  man  page
       of tixMkFileDialog for more details.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The  tixFileSelectbox  command  creates  a new Tcl command
       whose name is the same as the path name of the FileSelect-
       box's  window.  This command may be used to invoke various
       operations on the widget. It  has  the  following  general
       form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName  is the name of the command, which is the same as
       the FileSelectbox widget's path name.  Option and the args
       determine  the exact behavior of the command.  The follow-
       ing commands are possible for FileSelectbox widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path-
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the   values   accepted   by  the  tixFileSelectbox
              command.

       pathName filter
              Update  the  files  listed  in  the   FileSelectbox
              according to the filtering pattern sepcified in the
              Filter entry widget.

       pathName invoke
              Execute  the  command  specified  by  the  -command
              option in the Filter entry widget.

DEFAULT BINDINGS
       TIX  automatically  creates class bindings for FileSelect-
       boxes that give them the following default behavior:

       [1]    Mouse button 1 in the Directory listbox will change
              the filter string to the selected directory.

       [2]    Mouse button 1 in the Files listbox will change the
              filename that appears in the  Selection  entry.  It
              will  also trigger the -browsecmd if the option has
              been specified.

       [3]    The current directory will be changed by (1) double
              clicking  the Directory listbox or (2) invoking the
              Filter Combobox. Please refer to the  man  page  of
              tixCombobox  for  the  default bindings of the Com-
              boboxes and how they can be invoked.

       [4]    The command specified by the option  -command  will
              be invoked by (1) double clicking the Files listbox
              or (2) invoking Selection Combobox.
