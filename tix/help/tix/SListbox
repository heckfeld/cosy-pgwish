DESCRIPTION
       The tixScrolledListbox command creates a new window (given
       by  the  pathName  argument)   and   makes   it   into   a
       ScrolledListbox  widget.   Additional  options,  described
       above, may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the
       option  database to configure aspects of the ScrolledList-
       box such as its cursor and relief.

       The ScrolledListbox widget is a "convenience  widget".  It
       combinds two scrollbar widgets with the listbox widget and
       sets their behavior and appearance accordingly.

WIDGET COMMANDS
       The ScrolledListbox command  creates  a  new  Tcl  command
       whose   name   is  the  same  as  the  path  name  of  the
       ScrolledListbox's window.  This command  may  be  used  to
       invoke  various  operations on the widget. It has the fol-
       lowing general form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same  as
       the  frame widget's path name.  Option and the args deter-
       mine the exact behavior of  the  command.   The  following
       commands are possible for ScrolledListbox widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the
              widget.  If no option is specified, returns a  list
              describing  all  of the available options for path-
              Name (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information  on  the
              format  of this list).  If option is specified with
              no value, then the command returns a list  describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the  value
              returned  if  no  option  is specified).  If one or
              more option-value pairs  are  specified,  then  the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the  command
              returns  an  empty  string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the frame command.

       pathName listbox ?options?
              When no additional options  are  supplied,  returns
              the pathname of the listbox subwidget.

              When  additional  options are supplied, invokes the
              widget command of the listbox subwidget with  these
              options.

              The  listbox widget command provides a quick way to
              access the listbox subwidget. For example, you  can
              use  it to add items or delete items from the list-
              box subwidget. However,  please  don't  abuse  this
              command  and change the behavior of listbox subwid-
              get arbitrarily.

BINDINGS
       ScrolledListbox widgets have no default bindings.
