DESCRIPTION
       The  tixDlgBtns command creates a new window (given by the
       pathName argument) and makes it into a DlgBtns widget. The
       DlgBtns,  or  Dialog Buttons, widget is a container widget
       to hold the ``action'' buttons in  a  dialog  box.   Addi-
       tional  options,  described above, may be specified on the
       command line  or  in  the  option  database  to  configure
       aspects of the DlgBtns such as its cursor and relief.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The  DlgBtns  command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is the same as the path  name  of  the  DlgBtns's  window.
       This  command  may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same  as
       the  frame widget's path name.  Option and the args deter-
       mine the exact behavior of  the  command.   The  following
       commands are possible for DlgBtns widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the
              widget.  If no option is specified, returns a  list
              describing  all  of the available options for path-
              Name (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information  on  the
              format  of this list).  If option is specified with
              no value, then the command returns a list  describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the  value
              returned  if  no  option  is specified).  If one or
              more option-value pairs  are  specified,  then  the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the  command
              returns  an  empty  string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the frame command.

       pathName add buttonName ?option value ... ?
              Add a new button subwidget with the  name  bnutton-
              Name into the DlgBtns widget. Additional configura-
              tion options can be given to configure the new but-
              ton subwidget.

       pathName button bnuttonName ?args?
              The  button command provides a way to access a but-
              ton subwidget  contained  by  the  DlgBtns  widget.
              When no additional arguments are given this command
              returns return the complete pathname of the  button
              subwidget  with  the  name bnuttonName.  When addi-
              tional arguments are  given,  these  arguments  are
              used  to  invoke  the  widget command of the button
              subwidget.

       pathName invoke bnuttonName
              Invoke the button subwidget with the name  bnutton-
              Name.

BINDINGS
       DlgBtns widgets have no default bindings.

EXAMPLE
       The  following example creates a DlgBtns widget which con-
       tains several button subwidgets.

        tixDlgBtns .btns

        #Add some buttons in to the DlgBtns
        .btns add open  -text "Open"  -command "open_proc"
        .btns add close -text "CLose" -command "close_proc"

        #Further configure the "open" button
        .btns button open config -foreground red

        #Invoke the "open" button
        .btns invoke open
