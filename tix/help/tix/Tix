NAME
       TIX - Summary of the TIX widget set

SYNOPSIS
       tixInit  ?-beta boolean? ?-binding bName? ?-debug boolean?
       ?-fontset fName? ?-libdir path? ?-scheme sName?


DESCRIPTION
       TIX is a set of compound widgets based on TK  3.6.  It  is
       solely written in TCL using the TIX Intrinsics library and
       does not require any recompilation of TCL/TK.  The  latest
       release of Tix is Tix 3.6.

       To  use  the  TIX  widgets, you have to append the library
       directory of TIX to the auto-load path by using  the  fol-
       lowing  command:  (assuming that you have installed TIX in
       /usr/local/lib/tix)

       lappend auto_path /usr/local/lib/tix


       The TIX widget set must be initialized before you can  use
       it.  You  can initialize TIX using the command tixInit. It
       accetps the following options:


       -beta boolean: Specifies whether you want to use the  wid-
       gets inside the directory library/beta. Only values "true"
       and "false" are allowed. The widgets in this directory are
       consider  unstable  and you are advised not to use them in
       any critical applications. These widgets are  not  guaran-
       teed  to  be supported in the future. The default value is
       "true".

       -binding bName: Specifies the event bindings. In this ver-
       sion  of Tix, the bindings supported are Motif, which will
       make your application behave close to Motif(tm),  and  TK.
       The default is TK.

       -debug boolean: Specifies whether the Intrinsics should be
       debugged. Only values "true" and "false" are  allowed.  If
       this  option  is  enabled, all the internal errors will be
       printed. This option is useful for Tix  widget  developers
       and hackers.

       -fontset  fName: The fontset to use in your application. A
       fontset defines the fonts to be used as normal text,  bold
       font,  italic  font  ...  etc. In this version of Tix, the
       fontsets  supported  are  12Point,  14Point  and  TK.  The
       default is TK.

       -libdir  path: The path of the directory that contains the
       Tix library. The default value is /usr/local/lib/tix.
       -scheme sName: The color scheme to use  in  your  applica-
       tion.   In  this version of Tix, the schemes supported are
       Gray, SGIGray, Blue and TK. The default is TK.


Example TIX startup script
       #!/usr/local/bin/wish -f
       set TIX_LIBRARY  /usr/local/lib/tix

       lappend auto_path $TIX_LIBRARY
       tixInit -libdir $TIX_LIBRARY -scheme Gray -fontset 14Point -binding Motif

       # At here, jump to the start of your program


Files
       There are files in the demos directory in the TIX  distri-
       bution  that  illustrates  how you can include TIX in your
       application.
