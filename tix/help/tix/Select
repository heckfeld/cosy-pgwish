              Note: When the Select widget is first  constructed,
              the  default  selection  is  always  empty, even if

       Command-Line Switch:           -radio

              Specifies whether the Select widget should act as a
              radio-box.  Only values "true" and "false" will  be
              recognized.  When set to at most one button subwid-
              get can be selected at any time.

       Name:                          state

              Specifies  the  state of all the buttons inside the
              Select widget.

              Note: Setting this option using the  config  widget
              command will enable or disable all the buttons sub-
              widgets. Original states of the individual  buttons
              are  not  saved. Only the values "normal" and "dis-
              abled" are recognized.

       Name:                          value
       Class:                         Value
       Command-Line Switch:           -value

              Specifies the value of the Select. The value  of  a
              Select  widget is a list of the names of the button
              subwidgets that have been selected by the user.

              When you assign the value of a Select widget  using
              the "config -value" widget command, the TCL command
              specified by the -command option will be invoked if
              some  button  subwidgets  are toggled. This feature
              can be supressed by setting the  first  element  of
              the new value to be

               .select config -value {-nocallback item1 item4}


       Name:                          variable
       Class:                         Variable
       Command-Line Switch:           -variable

              Specifies the global variable in which the value of
              the Select should be stored. The value of a  Select
              widget is stored as a list of the names of the but-
              ton subwidgets that have been selected by the user.
              The  value  of  the  Control  will be automatically
              updated when this variable is changed.

DESCRIPTION
       The tixSelect command creates a new window (given  by  the
       pathName  argument)  and  makes  it  into a Select widget.
       Additional options, described above, may be  specified  on
       the  command  line  or in the option database to configure
       aspects of the Select such as its cursor and relief.

       The Select widget is a versatile container for button sub-
       widgets.  It can be used to provide radio-box or check-box
       style of selection options for the user.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The Select command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       the  same  as  the path name of the Select's window.  This
       command may be used to invoke various  operations  on  the
       widget.  It has the following general form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName  is the name of the command, which is the same as
       the frame widget's path name.  Option and the args  deter-
       mine  the  exact  behavior  of the command.  The following
       commands are possible for Select widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path-
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the values accepted by the frame command.

       pathName add buttonName ?option value ... ?
              Add  a  new button subwidget with the name bnutton-
              Name into the Select widget. Additional  configura-
              tion options can be given to configure the new but-
              ton subwidget.

       pathName button bnuttonName ?args?
              The button command provides a way to access a  but-
              ton subwidget contained by the Select widget.  When
              no additional  arguments  are  given  this  command
              returns  return the complete pathname of the button
              subwidget with the name  bnuttonName.   When  addi-
              tional  arguments  are  given,  these arguments are
              used to invoke the widget  command  of  the  button
              subwidget.

       pathName invoke bnuttonName
              Invoke  the button subwidget with the name bnutton-
              Name.

BINDINGS
       Select widgets have no default bindings.

EXAMPLE
       The following example creates a  radio-box  style  iconbar
       for the user to choose one value among

        tixSelect .s -radio true -allowzero false
        .s add eat   -bitmap @pixmaps/eat.xpm
        .s add work  -bitmap @pixmaps/work.xpm
        .s add sleep -bitmap @pixmaps/eat.xpm
