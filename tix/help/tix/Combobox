DESCRIPTION
       The tixCombobox command creates a new window (given by the
       pathName argument) and makes it into  a  Combobox  widget.
       Additional  options,  described above, may be specified on
       the command line or in the option  database  to  configure
       aspects of the Combobox such as its cursor and relief.

       The  Tix  Combobox widget is similar to the combo box con-
       trol in MS Windows. The user can give a choice  by  either
       typing in the entry subwdget or selecting inside the list-
       box subwidget.

WIDGET COMMANDS
       The Combobox command creates a new Tcl command whose  name
       is  the  same  as  the path name of the Combobox's window.
       This command may be used to invoke various  operations  on
       the widget. It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName  is the name of the command, which is the same as
       the frame widget's path name.  Option and the args  deter-
       mine  the  exact  behavior  of the command.  The following
       commands are possible for Combobox widgets:
       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path-
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the values accepted by the frame command.

       pathName addhistory string
              Add the string to the beinning of the listbox.

       pathName appendhistory string
              Append the string to the end of the listbox.

       pathName entry ?options?
              When no options are given, this command returns the
              pathname of the entry subwidget.

              When options are given, the widget command  of  the
              entry  subwidget will be called with these options.

       pathName get
              return the current user input in the entry  subwid-
              get.

       pathName listbox ?options?
              When no options are given, this command returns the
              pathname of the listbox subwidget.

              When options are given, the widget command  of  the
              listbox   subwidget   will  be  called  with  these
              options.

       pathName pick string
              Set the content of the entry subwidget to  be  this
              string.

       pathName pick -at index
              Select the index'th item inside the lixtbox subwid-
              get and put it inside the entry subwidget.
