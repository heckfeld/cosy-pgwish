NAME
       tixMkFileDialog  - Convenience function for creating stan-
       dard file selection dialog boxes.

SYNOPSIS
       tixMkFileDialog pathName okcmd ?helpcmd?

DESCRIPTION
       tixMkFileDialog creates a standard standard file selection
       dialog  box  using  the  tixFileSelectBox  widget  and the
       tixStdDlgBtns widget.

       The first argument pathName specifies the name of the  top
       level window that holds the dialog box.

       The  second  argument  okcmd  specify a command to execute
       when the OK button is invoked in the dialog. okcmd will be
       called   with   one  additional  parameter:  the  filename
       selected in the dialog box. If no file is selected,  okcmd
       will be called with an empty string.

       The  third  argument  helpcmd  is optional. It specifies a
       command to execute when the Help button in the  dialog  is
       invoked.  If  the helpcmd is not supplied, the Help button
       is disalbed.

       When the user selects the Close  button  inside  the  file
       selection  dialog,  the window is merely withdrawn but not
       destroyed. Since the file selection doialog  usually  will
       be  used for many times during the execution of a program,
       this will  makes  more  efficient  use  of  the  resources
       because  the  complex  dialog  does not need to be created
       every time it is opened. You can use the  destroy  command
       to destroy the dialog when it is necessary.
