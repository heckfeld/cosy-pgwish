WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:                          label
       Class:                         Label
       Command-Line Switch:           -label

DESCRIPTION
       The tixLabelFrame command creates a new window  (given  by
       the pathName argument) and makes it into a LabelFrame wid-
       get.  Additional options, described above, may  be  speci-
       fied on the command line or in the option database to con-
       figure aspects of the LabelFrame such  as  its  background
       color and relief.

       LabelFrames are used to group related items under the same
       heading.  A LabelFrame consists of a few sub-frames.  Nor-
       mally  you  should  pack into the innermost sub-frame of a
       LabelFrame. The tixLabelFrame  command  returns  the  path
       name of the innermost sub-frame.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The  LabelFrame  command  creates  a new Tcl command whose
       name is the same as the path name of the  frame's  window.
       This  command  may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same  as
       the  frame widget's path name.  Option and the args deter-
       mine the exact behavior of  the  command.   The  following
       commands are possible for frame widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query  or  modify  the configuration options of the
              widget.  If no option is specified, returns a  list
              describing   all   of  the  available  options  for
              pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for  information  on
              the  format  of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then  the  command  returns  a  list
              describing  the one named option (this list will be
              identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
              returned  if  no  option  is specified).  If one or
              more option-value pairs  are  specified,  then  the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the  command
              returns  an  empty  string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the frame command.

BINDINGS
       When a new labelFrame is created, it has no default  event
       bindings:  LabelFrames are not intended to be interactive.

EXAMPLE
       The following example  creates  a  group  of  button  that
       belongs to the group "Nations"

       set f [tixLabelFrame .lbf -label Nations -bd 2 -padx 2 -pady 2]
       button $f.b1 -text "America"
       button $f.b2 -text "Canada"
       button $f.b3 -text "Mexico"
       pack $f.b1 $f.b2 $f.b3 -fill x
       pack .lbf
