The only change that I made to the intrinsics was a way to check all
options before commiting them.  For example, in tk, if I have a button
.b, and I do the following

   .b config -fg red -bg badcolor

Nothing will occur because one of the options is bad.  What I put it was
a way to say, "Check if all the arguments are OK.  If they are, commit them."
The other advantage this gave me was if I changed two options that affected
the same item, the changes would occur at once, not individually.

There are three files I have included:
  tix/Notebook.tcl, tix/Intrinsc.tcl, and test.tcl, a program to test it.

To test:
% source test.tcl
% mkCall "Make Call"
