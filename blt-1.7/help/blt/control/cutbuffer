SYNOPSIS
       blt_cutbuffer get ?bufNum?
       blt_cutbuffer rotate ?count?
       blt_cutbuffer set value ?bufNum?


DESCRIPTION
       The  blt_cutbuffer  command  allows  you to get or set the
       values  of  the  eight  X  cut  buffer   properties.   The
       blt_cutbuffer command also allows you to rotate the values

       range from 0 to 7 inclusive and default to 0 if not speci-
       fied.

CUTBUFFER COMMANDS
       The   following   commands   are   available    for    the
       blt_cutbuffer:

       blt_cutbuffer get ?bufNum?
              Returns  the  value of a cutbuffer.  BufNum must be
              in the range from 0 to 7 inclusive and defaults  to
              0  if not specified.  The cutbuffer is returned as-
              is except, NUL bytes are converted to the '@' char-
              acter.   If the specified cut buffer does not exist
              the empty string is returned.

       blt_cutbuffer rotate ?count?
              Rotates the cut buffers by count. Count is an inte-
              ger  number in the range from -7 to 7 inclusive and
              defaults to 1 if it is not specified.

       blt_cutbuffer set value ?bufNum?
              Sets the specified cutbuffer to value.  BufNum must
              be  an integer number in the range 0 to 7 inclusive
              and defaults to zero if not specified.   This  com-
              mand returns the empty string.
