NAME
       blt_debug - print Tcl commands before execution

SYNOPSIS
       blt_debug ?level?

DESCRIPTION
       This command acts as a simple trace for Tcl commands.  The
       command is printed on standard error before and after sub-
       stitutions  have  occurred.  Level indicates at what level
       to stop tracing commands.  If level is 0,  no  tracing  is
       performed. This is the default.

       If  no  level  argument  is  given,  the  current level is
       printed.

CAVEATS
       This interface will probably change  dramatically  in  the
       next release with new functionality.
