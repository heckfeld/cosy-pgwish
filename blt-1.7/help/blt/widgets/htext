WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           fileName
       Class:          FileName
       Command-Line Switch:-filename

              Specifies a blt_htext file to be displayed  in  the
              window.   If  the  value  is  the empty string, the
              -text option is used instead.  See the section FILE
              FORMAT for a description of the blt_htext file for-
              mat.

       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:-height

              Specifies the desired height of the  viewport  win-
              dow.  The  value  must  be  in  a  form accepted by
              Tk_GetPixels. If the value is less  than  one,  the
              window  will  grow to accommodate the entire length
              of text.

       Name:           specialChar
       Class:          SpecialChar
       Command-Line Switch:-specialchar

              Specifies the ASCII value  of  the  special  double
              character delimiters.  In blt_htext files, the text
              between these special characters is evaluated as  a
              block  of Tcl commands. The default special charac-
              ter is the percent sign.

       Name:           lineSpacing
       Class:          LineSpacing
       Command-Line Switch:-linespacing

              Specifies the spacing between each  line  of  text.
              The   value   must   be   in  a  form  accepted  by
              Tk_GetPixels. The default value is 1 pixel.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:-width

              Specifies the desired width of the viewport window.
              The   value   must   be   in  a  form  accepted  by
              Tk_GetPixels. If the value is less  than  one,  the
              window  will grow to accommodate the widest line of
              text.

       Name:           xScrollUnits
       Class:          ScrollUnits
       Command-Line Switch:-xscrollunits

              Specifies the horizontal  scrolling  distance.  The
              default is 10 pixels.

       Name:           yScrollUnits
       Class:          ScrollUnits
       Command-Line Switch:-yscrollunits

              Specifies  the  vertical  scrolling  distance.  The
              default is 10 pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       The blt_htext command creates a new window (given  by  the
       pathName  argument)  and makes it into a blt_htext widget.
       Additional options, described above, may be  specified  on
       the  command  line  or in the option database to configure
       aspects of the widget such as its color and font.  At  the
       time  this command is invoked, there must not exist a win-
       dow named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.  The
       blt_htext command returns its pathName.

       The blt_htext widget is hybrid of a non-editable text wid-
       get and a geometry manager (e.g. the packer).  It displays
       text (optionally read from file) in a window.  Text can be
       scrolled  either  horizontally  or  vertically  using  the
       blt_htext window as a viewport.  In addition, Tcl commands
       can be embedded into the text which are evaluated  as  the
       text  is  parsed.   Text between special double characters
       (percent signs "%%") is  immediately  passed  to  the  Tcl
       interpreter for evaluation.

       Furthermore,  any widget or widget hierarchy can be packed
       in-line and made to appear on  the  current  line  of  the
       text.   Widgets are packed using the blt_htext append com-
       mand.  All widgets must be children of the blt_htext  win-
       dow  and must already exist before packing.  Once a widget
       has been packed it cannot be moved to a different position
       within  the  text.   Widgets  can be resized but they will
       remain at the same position within the text.

       Before a file or text string is parsed  by  the  blt_htext
       widget,  all  the widget's current children are destroyed.
       You can  reload  files  or  text  without  worrying  about
       unmapping or destroying each child window beforehand.

       Setting  the  either  the -filename or -text configuration
       option will adjust  the  value  of  the  other.   If  both
       options  are  set,  the file takes precedence.  When a new
       file is read using the -filename option, the value of  the
       -text option is reset to the empty string.  Likewise, when
       the -text option  is  set,  the  string  representing  the
       -filename option is cleared.

FILE FORMAT
       The format of blt_htext text file is typically ASCII text.
       Text enclosed by special double  characters  (by  default,
       percent  signs  '%%')  is  interpreted and executed as Tcl
       commands.  The special character  may be specified by  the
       -specialchar  option.   In  the  following  example  of  a
       blt_htext file,  a button widget is appended to  the  text
       between   the  words "a" and "which".  The pathName of the
       blt_htext widget is ".ht".

              This will be displayed as normal text.
              But this will become a %%
                button .ht.button -text "button" -fg red
                .ht append .ht.button
              %% which can invoke a Tcl command.


VARIABLES
       The following global Tcl variables are maintained when  an
       blt_htext file is parsed.

       blt_htext(widget)
              is the pathname of the blt_htext widget.

       blt_htext(file)
              is  the  name  of  the file the blt_htext widget is
              currently parsing.  It is the empty string when the
              -text option is used.

       blt_htext(line)
              is the current line number in the text.

       This  information  might  be used to construct hyper links
       between different files and/or lines.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The blt_htext command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is  pathName.   This command may be used to invoke various
       operations on the widget.  It has  the  following  general
       form:

              pathName option ?args?
       Option  and  args  determine  the  exact  behavior  of the
       command.

       The following widget commands are available for  blt_htext
       widgets:

       pathName append child
              Packs  child  at  the current position in the text.
              Child is the name of a window to be packed into the
              blt_htext  window.   Child  must  be a child of the
              blt_htext window and may be specified by either its
              pathName or name.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Queries  or  modifies  the configuration options of
              the widget.  If no option is specified,  returns  a
              list  describing  all  of the available options for
              pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for  information  on
              the  format  of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then  the  command  returns  a  list
              describing  the one named option (this list will be
              identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
              returned  if  no  option  is specified).  If one or
              more option-value pairs  are  specified,  then  the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);  in  this  case  the  command
              returns  the  empty string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the blt_htext command.

       pathName gotoline ?line?
              Scrolls the text to line.  Line is the line  number
              of  the  new  text  position  and is bounded by the
              range of lines in the text.  If a line argument  is
              not present, the current line number is returned.

       pathName childconfigure child
              Queries  or  resets the positioning of child or the
              size of the cavity surrounding it. This command  is
              similar  to  the  configure command, except that it
              applies to the options of the child window and  its
              cavity,  whereas  configure applies  to the options
              for the widget as a whole. Child  is  the  name  of
              window  packed  into  the  blt_htext window (by the
              blt_htext append command). The child widget may  be
              specified by either its pathName or name.  The fol-
              lowing options are available.

              -anchor anchorPos
                     Specifies  how  the  child  window  will  be
                     arranged if there is extra space in the cav-
                     ity surrounding the  window.  Anchorpos  may
                     have   any   of   the   forms   accepted  by
                     Tk_GetAnchor.  For example, if anchorPos  is
                     center  then  the  window is centered in the
                     cavity; if anchorPos is w  then  the  window
                     will  be  drawn such it touches the leftmost
                     edge of the cavity. This option defaults  to
                     center.

              -fill style
                     Indicates  if  the  child  window  should be
                     expanded to occupy any extra  space  in  the
                     cavity surrounding it.  Style must be one of
                     the following: none, x, y, both.   If  style
                     is  x,  the  width  of  the  child window is
                     expanded to fill the cavity.  If style is y,
                     the height is expanded. The default is none.

              -height value
                     Species the height of the cavity  containing
                     the  child  window.  Value must be in a form
                     accepted  by  Tk_GetPixels.   If  value   is
                     greater  than zero, the cavity is resized to
                     that height.  If the requested window height
                     is  greater  than  the  cavity's height, the
                     window will be reduced to  fit  the  cavity.
                     By  default,  the cavity is requested height
                     of the child window.

              -ipadx value
                     Specifies extra  padding  to  the  left  and
                     right sides of the child window.  Value must
                     be in a form accepted by Tk_GetPixels.

              -ipady value
                     Specifies extra padding to the top and  bot-
                     tom  sides  of the child window.  Value must
                     be in a form accepted by Tk_GetPixels.

              -justify value
                     Justifies the vertical position of the  cav-
                     ity  containing the child widget in relation
                     to the line of text. Value  must  be  either
                     top,  bottom,  or   center.  By default, the
                     child widget is centered along the  baseline
                     of the line of text.

              -padx value
                     Specifies  the padding to the left and right
                     sides of the  cavity  containing  the  child
                     window.  Value must be in a form accepted by
                     Tk_GetPixels.

              -pady value
                     Specifies the padding on the top and  bottom
                     sides  of  the  cavity  containing the child
                     window.  Value must be in a form accepted by
                     Tk_GetPixels.
              -relheight value
                     Specifies  the height of the cavity contain-
                     ing the child window relative to the  height
                     of  the viewport window.  Value is real num-
                     ber indicating the ratio of  the  height  of
                     the cavity to the viewport.  If value is 0.0
                     or less, the  request  is  ignored  and  the
                     height of the cavity is the requested height
                     of the child window.

              -relwidth value
                     Specifies the width of the cavity containing
                     the  child  window  relative to the width of
                     the viewport window.  Value is  real  number
                     indicating  the  ratio  of  the width of the
                     cavity to the viewport.  If value is 0.0  or
                     less,  the  request is ignored and the width
                     of the cavity is the requested width of  the
                     child window.

              -width value
                     Species  the  width of the cavity containing
                     the child window.  Value must be in  a  form
                     accepted   by  Tk_GetPixels.   If  value  is
                     greater than zero, the cavity is resized  to
                     that  width.   If the requested window width
                     is greater than the cavity's width, the win-
                     dow  will  be reduced to fit the cavity.  By
                     default, the cavity is  requested  width  of
                     the child window.

       pathName scan option args
              This  command  is  used  to  implement  scanning on
              texts.  It has two forms, depending on option:

              pathName scan mark y
                     Records y and the current view in  the  text
                     window;  used in conjunction with later scan
                     dragto commands.  Typically this command  is
                     associated  with a mouse button press in the
                     widget.  It returns an empty string.

              pathName scan dragto y
                     This command computes the difference between
                     its  y  argument  and  the y argument to the
                     last scan mark command for the  widget.   It
                     then adjusts the view up or down by 10 times
                     the difference in y-coordinates.  This  com-
                     mand  is  typically  associated  with  mouse
                     motion events in the widget, to produce  the
                     effect  of  dragging  the text at high speed
                     through the window.  The return value is  an
                     empty string.
       pathName search pattern ?from? ?to?
              Returns  the  number of the next line matching pat-
              tern.  Pattern is a string which obeys the matching
              rules  of  Tcl_StringMatch.   From  and to are text
              line numbers (inclusive) which  bound  the  search.
              If  no  match  for  pattern  can  be  found,  -1 is
              returned.

       pathName xview ?position?
              Moves the viewport horizontally to the new text  x-
              coordinate  position.   Position is the offset from
              the left side of the text to the  current  position
              and  must be in a form accepted by Tk_GetPixels. If
              position is not present, the current text  position
              is returned.

       pathName yview ?position?
              Moves  the  viewport  vertically to the new text y-
              coordinate position.  Position is the  offset  from
              the  top  of  the  text to the current position and
              must be in a  form  accepted  by  Tk_GetPixels.  If
              position  is not present, the current text position
              is returned.

BUGS
