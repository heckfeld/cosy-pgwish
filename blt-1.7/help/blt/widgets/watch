DESCRIPTION
       This command arranges for  Tcl  procedures  to  be  called
       before  and/or  after  each the execution of each Tcl com-
       mand.  This command may be useful in the logging,  profil-
       ing, or tracing of Tcl code.

WATCH COMMANDS
       The following commands are available for the blt_watch:

       blt_watch activate name
              Activates  the  watch,  causing Tcl commands the be
              traced to the maximum depth selected.

       blt_watch create name ?options?...
              Creates a new watch name. It's an error if  another
              watch name already exists and an error message will
              be returned.  Options may have any  of  the  values
              accepted  by the blt_watch configure command.  This
              command returns the empty string.

       blt_watch configure name ?options...?
              Queries or modifies the  configuration  options  of
              the  watch  name.   Name  is  the  name of a watch.
              Options may have any of the following values:

              -active boolean
                     Specifies  if  the  watch  is  active.    By
                     default, watches are active when created.

              -postcmd string
                     Specifies a Tcl procedure to be called after
                     each Tcl command.  String is name of  a  Tcl
                     procedure and optionally any extra arguments
                     to be passed  to  it.   Five  arguments  are
                     appended:   1)  the  current  level  2)  the
                     command string 3) a list containing the com-
                     mand  after  substitutions  and  split  into
                     words 4) the return code of the previous Tcl
                     command,  and 5) the results of the previous
                     command.  The return status of  the  postcmd
                     procedure is always ignored.

              -precmd string
                     Specifies  a  Tcl  procedure  to  be  called
                     before each Tcl command.  String is name  of
                     a  Tcl  procedure  and  optionally any extra
                     arguments to be passed to it.   Three  argu-
                     ments  are appended: 1) the current level 2)
                     the command string, and  3) a list  contain-
                     ing  the  command  after  substitutions  and
                     split into words.  The return status of  the
                     precmd procedure is always ignored.

              -maxlevel number
                     Specifies  the  maximum  evaluation depth to
                     watch Tcl  commands.   The  default  maximum
                     level is 10000.

              blt_watch deactivate name
                     Deactivates  the watch, causing Tcl commands
                     to be no longer traced.

              blt_watch info name
                     Returns the configuration information  asso-
                     ciated  with  the  watch  name.  Name is the
                     name of a watch.

              blt_watch names ?how?
                     Lists the names of the watches for  a  given
                     state.   How  may  be  one of the following:
                     active, idle, or ignore.  If no how argument
                     is specified all, watches are listed.

       If  no  level  argument  is  given,  the  current level is
       printed.

EXAMPLE
       The following example use blt_watch to trace Tcl  commands
       (printing  to  standard  error) both before and after they
       are executed.


              proc preCmd { level command argv } {
                  set name [lindex $argv 0]
                  puts stderr "$level $name => $command"
              }

              proc postCmd { level command argv retcode results } {
                  set name [lindex $argv 0]
                  puts stderr "$level $name => $argv0= ($retcode) $results"
              }

              blt_watch create trace   -postcmd postCmd -precmd preCmd
