.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBblt_barchart\fR command creates a new window (given by the 
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into an barchart widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
or in the option database
to configure aspects of the graph such as its colors and font.
The \fBblt_barchart\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR, but
\fIpathName\fR's parent must exist.
.PP
The \fBblt_barchart\fR widget plots two-variable data as
rectangular bars in a window.  The x-coordinate values designate
the position of the bar along the x-axis, while the y-coordinate
values designate the magnitude.
The \fBblt_barchart\fR has of several components; coordinate axes, 
crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.
.SS "COORDINATE AXES"
The barchart widget has four axes, two standard (x and y) and two alternate
(x2 and y2).  Graph elements and tags are mapped onto one x-axis and 
one y-axis (by default, they are mapped onto the standard axes).
.PP
Each axis consists of the axis line and major and minor ticks placed 
at set intervals.  At major ticks, labels (text strings) representing 
the coordinate value of the tick are drawn.  By default, the tick labels 
are simply numeric strings.  However, a Tcl procedure may be supplied 
to format individually each tick label.
.PP
The scale of the axis is determined its minimum and maximum limits.
By default, each axis is auto-scaled using the limits of the data.
However either limit can be set to manually scale the graph.
.SS "CROSSHAIRS"
Crosshairs are a set of two lines (vertical and horizontal) which
intersect on the graph.  They are implemented using XOR drawing
primitives, so they do not require the graph to be redrawn when 
they are moved or redisplayed.
.SS "ELEMENTS"
A graph element is a set of data points and configuration options 
which determine how the bar is displayed in the window.  Elements 
are created by the \fBelement create\fP widget command.  The configuration 
options may be specified as the element is created or later by 
the \fBelement configure\fR 
widget command.  There is an internal display list of element names which 
controls the drawing order of the elements. By default, elements are 
appended to the display list as they are created.  The element display list
can be managed by the \fBelement show\fR command.  
.SS "LEGEND"
The legend consists of a list of entries, where each entry is an element
symbol and label.  By default, the legend is located in the right
margin of the graph.  However, the legend may appear anywhere in the
plotting area of the graph by specifying its window coordinates.
.SS "TAGS"
Tags are simple drawing procedures used to annotate or highlight
areas of the graph. A tag may be either a text string, bitmap,
line, window, or polygon.  A tag may be associated with a particular 
element, so that the tag is displayed only if the element is 
displayed.  Tags are the first items drawn when the graph is displayed, 
so that elements, symbols, legend, and axes always appear in front of them.  
.PP
Tags differ from elements in that they do not affect the auto-scaling of 
coordinate axes.  Furthermore, tags can have \fIelastic\fR coordinates
(specified by \fC-Inf\fR and \fCInf\fR respectively) which translate into
the axis minimum or maximum limit.  For example, to place a tag so it
always remains in the lower left corner of the plot, use the coordinates
\fC-Inf\fR,\fC-Inf\fR.
.SH "WIDGET COMMANDS"
.PP
The \fBblt_barchart\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are valid for \fBblt_barchart\fR widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \fBconfigure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the widget. 
Valids options are described in
.SB WIDGET OPTIONS.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcrosshairs configure\fR ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the crosshairs.
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options of the crosshairs, whereas \fBconfigure\fR applies 
to the options for the graph as a whole.  See 
.SB CROSSHAIRS OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcrosshairs toggle\fR
Toggles the current state of the crosshairs, turning them on or off.
This command returns an empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement append \fIname coords\fR
Appends pairs of x,y data points to element \fIname\fR.  
\fIcoords\fR is a list of numeric expressions (x,y graph coordinates) 
representing data points.  It returns the empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement configure \fIname \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options of an individual element, whereas
\fBconfigure\fR applies to the options for the graph as a whole.
\fIOptions\fR may have any of the values accepted by the
\fBelement create\fR widget command. See
.SB ELEMENT OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement create \fIname \fR?\fIoptions...\fR? 
Creates a new element \fIname\fP in the graph.  Element names must be
unique, so \fIname\fR can not already exist in the graph.  
If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the 
element options (see 
.SB ELEMENT OPTIONS
).
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement delete ?\fIname ...\fR?
Deletes the element \fIname\fR from the graph.  
Returns the empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement names\fR
Returns a list of all elements. This differs from
\fBelement show\fR in that it returns the names of all elements, not
just those in the element display list.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBelement show \fR?\fInames\fR?
Queries or resets the element display list.  
The element display
list defines which elements are drawn and in what order.  
\fINames\fR is a list of the elements to
be displayed.  If there is no \fInames\fR argument, the list of elements 
currently being displayed is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinvtransform \fIwinX winY\fP

coordinates to graph coordinates (using the standard x and y axes).  
Returns a list of containing the x and y graph coordinates.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend activate \fIname...\fR
.VS
Specifies that the legend entries of the named elements should be drawn 
with the active legend background and foreground colors.  The entries may 
also be drawn with a different relief (using the \fB-activerelief\fR and 
\fB-activeborderwidth\fR options).
\fIName\fR is the name of an element in the graph.
.VE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend configure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that it
applies to the options for the legend, whereas \fBconfigure\fR applies
to the options for the graph as a whole.  See 
.SB LEGEND OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.  
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlegend deactivate \fIname...\fR
.VS
Specifies that the legend enties of the named elements should be drawn 
with the legend background and foreground colors.  \fIName\fR is the 
name of an element in the graph.

.VS
Returns the name of the graph element at the current screen position
in the legend.  \fIString\fR must be in the form \fI@x,y\fR, where 
\fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are the window coordinates.  If the given screen 
coordinates do not lie over a legend entry, the empty string is returned.
.VE
.SB LEGEND OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.  
.TP
\fIpathName \fBpostscript \fR?\fIfileName\fR? ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Generates PostScript commands to print the graph. If no \fIfileName\fR
argument is present, the PostScript output is returned. Otherwise,
\fIfileName\fR is created and will contain the PostScript output.  In
this case the empty string is returned.  If any \fIoption-value\fR
pairs are present, they set configuration options controlling how the
PostScript is generated. See 
.SB POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS
for a description of valid options.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBpsconfigure \fR?\fIoptions...\fR?

\fIpathName \fBtag after \fItagId\fR ?\fItagId\fR?
Reorders the tag display list placing the first tag specified after
the second.  If no second \fItagId\fR argument is specified, the tag
is placed at the end of the list.  This command can be used to control
how tags are displayed since tags are drawn in the order of this
display list.  The empty string is returned.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtag before \fItagId\fR ?\fItagId\fR?
Reorders the tag display list placing the first tag specified before
the second.  If no second \fItagId\fR argument is specified, the tag
is placed at the beginning of the list.  This command can be used to

.SH "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.SS "WIDGET OPTIONS"
The following widget options are valid for the \fBconfigure\fR command.  
.DS
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
.DE
The \fBconfigure\fR command queries or modifies the configuration options 
of the widget.  If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list 
describing all of the
available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  
If \fIoption\fR is specified with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command 
returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be 
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if 
no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If one or more \fIoption\-value\fR 
pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns the empty string.  
.TP

If there is such an element, then the font information contained in
that element is used in the PostScript output.  (If the point size 
is omitted from the list, the point size of the X font is used).
Otherwise the X font is examined in an attempt to guess what PostScript 
font to use.  This works only for fonts whose foundry property is

in rotated output the \f(BIx\fR axis runs along the long dimension of the
page (``landscape'' orientation).
Defaults to \fCfalse\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pageanchor \fIanchor\fR
Specifies which point of the printed area should be appear over
the positioning point on the page (which is given by the \fB\-pagex\fR
and \fB\-pagey\fR options).
For example, \fB\-pageanchor n\fR means that the top center of the
printed area should be over the positioning point.
Defaults to \fCnw\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pageheight \fIsize\fR
Specifies that the height of the graph drawn in PostScript.
The graph is \fInot\fR uniformly scaled since this also scales
the fonts.  \fISize\fR may be any value accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The resulting pixel value is then converted to postscript printer
points.  This means that a height \fI8i\fR will be properly
converted to 8 inches. This options defaults to the height of the graph window.
.TP
\fB\-pagewidth \fIsize\fR
Specifies that the width of the graph drawn in PostScript.
The graph is \fInot\fR uniformly scaled since this also scales
the fonts.  \fISize\fR may be any value accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The resulting pixel value is then converted to postscript printer
points.  This means that a width \fI6.5i\fR will be properly
converted to 6.5 inches. This options defaults to the width of the graph window.
.TP
\fB\-pagex \fIposition\fR
Specifies the x-coordinate of the page positioning point.
This (with the \fB-pageanchor\fR option) indicates 
where the graph is placed on the PostScript page.
\fIPosition\fR may be any value accepted by 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR. The resulting pixel value is then converted to 
postscript printer points.  The default is \fC1i\fR.
.TP
\fB\-pagey \fIposition\fR
Specifies the y-coordinate of the page positioning point.
This (with the \fB-pageanchor\fR option) indicates 
where the graph is placed on the PostScript page.
\fIPosition\fR may be any value accepted by 
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR. The resulting pixel value is then converted to 
postscript printer points.  The default is \fC1i\fR.
.SH BINDINGS
.PP
There are no default bindings. 
.SH BUGS
.PP
Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max limits
as boundaries when the axis is logarithmically scaled.  
.PP
The needs to be a special mapping for undefined log scale values (>= 0.0). 
Possibly set up a "red zone" of undefined values which divides the 
positive and negative values.
.PP
The PostScript output generated for polygons with more than 1500 points 
may exceed the limits of some printers (See PostScript Language Reference 
Manual, page 568).  The work-around is to break the polygon into
separate pieces.
