.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBblt_table\fR command is a geometry manager for Tk. It arranges 
windows tabularly in
a window called the \fImaster\fR.  The table consists of individual
rows and columns whose spacing define its layout. Windows, called 
\fIslaves\fR, are positioned in the table by specifying the row and column.
Only one slave can be specified at a single position in the table.  But slaves 
may span multiple rows and columns.
.PP
By default, \fBblt_table\fR tries to arrange all its slaves in the minimum 
space required. It determines this by querying each slave window for
its requested size.  The maximum requested height all slaves spanning a 
particular row is the row's normal size.  Similarly, the maximum 
requested width of all slaves spanning a particular column is the column's 
normal size.  This, in turn, specifies the table's size, which 
is the sum of the normal sizes of the rows and columns.
The number of rows and columns a table contains
is determined by the indices specified.  
There is no mechanism to delete a row or column.
.SH TABLE INDICES
An \fIindex\fR references a row,column position in the table.
It must be in the form "\fIrow\fR,\fIcolumn\fR" where \fIrow\fR and 
\fIcolumn\fR are the respective row and column
numbers, starting from zero  (0,0 is the upper leftmost  position). 
\fIRow\fR and \fIcolumn\fR may also be numeric expressions which are 
recursively evaluated.  
.SH SIZE CONSTRAINTS
You can limit the amount of space requested by a slave window.
By specifying both a minimum and maximum limit in which the window's 
requested size must fall, you can bound a window's size.  This affects
the calculation of the normal size of all rows and columns which
it spans. In a similar fashion, you can directly control the 
normal size of any row or column. 
.PP
This provides two features.
Slave windows must be contained within the rows and columns they are 
defined to span.  By limiting the size of a row or column, you control 
the size of all windows in spanning it. This overrides whatever
size the slave has requested.  Secondly, there's no requirement 
that a row or column contain any slaves. This means you can create 
horizontal or vertical spacing by simply setting the row or column limits.
.SH RESIZING
\fBBlt_table\fR tries to fit itself exactly in the master window.  It first
tries to change the size of the master to the table's normal size.
If this fails, it then tries to expand or shrink itself to the size of 
the master.
If normal size of the table is smaller than the master window, the 
extra space is evenly divided among the rows or columns. If it's larger, 
then the row and columns are shrunk to fit in the master window.  In both 
cases, the rows and column sizes are changed with respect to their constraints.
.PP
You can also specify how an individual row or column is to be resized. 
For example, a column may be set to one of four modes:
.RS
.IP \fBnone\fR
Don't resize the column.
.IP \fBexpand\fR
Allow the column to only grow greater than its normal width.
.IP \fBshrink\fR
Allow the column to only shrink less than its normal width.
.IP \fBboth\fR
Resize the column in either direction.

.SH CREATING A TABLE
Tables are created by invoking the \fBblt_table\fR command.
.DS
	\fBblt_table\fR \fImaster\fR
.DE
\fIMaster\fR is the pathname of a window which must already exist.
\fBBlt_table\fR will arrange its slave windows inside of \fImaster\fR.
Slave windows are added by designating the slave window's pathname and 
table position.
.DS
	\fBblt_table\fR \fImaster slave index\fR
.DE
.SH TABLE COMMANDS
The following commands are available for the \fBblt_table\fR:
.TP
\fBblt_table \fImaster\fR ?\fIslave index options\fR?...
Adds the window \fIslave\fR to the table associated with \fImaster\fR.
If a table doesn't exist for \fImaster\fR, one is created.
\fIMaster\fR is the pathname of the window in which the slave windows
will be arranged. \fISlave\fR is the pathname of the window to be arranged
inside of \fImaster\fR at the position designated by \fIindex\fR.
This command returns the empty string.  
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the 
\fBblt_table configure\fR command.
.TP
\fBblt_table column \fImaster \fBconfigure \fIcolumnIndex\fR ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Queries or modifies the configuration options of the columns specified.
\fIColumnIndex\fR may be in one of two forms; \fBall\fR 
(indicating all columns) or a list of the column indices to be configured.  
\fIOptions\fR may have any of the following values:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-padx \fIpixels\fR
Specifies an extra padding to the normal width of the column.
\fIPixels\fR can be any value accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The default padding is \fB0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-resize \fImode\fR
Indicates that the column can expand or shrink from its normal width 
when the table is resized.
\fIMode\fR must be one of the following:
\fBnone\fR, \fBexpand\fR, \fBshrink\fR, or \fBboth\fR.  If \fImode\fR is 
\fBexpand\fR the width of the column is expanded if there is extra space
in the master window. If \fIstyle\fR is \fBshrink\fR its width may be
reduced beyond its normal width if there is not enough space in the master.
The default is \fBnone\fR.
.TP
\fB\-width \fIwidth\fR
Specifies the limits within which the width of the column may expand or 
shrink.  
\fIWidth\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the section 
.SB BOUNDING LIST FORMAT
for a description of this list.
By default there are no constraints.
.RE
.TP
\fBblt_table column \fImaster\fB dimension\fR
Returns the number of columns in the table.
.TP
\fBblt_table column \fImaster \fBinfo\fI columnIndex\fR 
Returns a list of the configuration options for the columns specified.
\fIColumnIndex\fR may be in one of two forms; \fBall\fR 
(indicating all columns) or a list of column indices.
The column indices may themselves be numeric expressions.
.TP
\fBblt_table column \fImaster\fB sizes\fI columnIndex\fR
Returns the sizes of the given columns in the table.
\fIColumnIndex\fR may be in one of two forms; \fBall\fR 
(indicating all columns) or a list of column indices. 
The column indices may themselves be numeric expressions.
.TP
\fBblt_table configure\fR \fIslave\fR ?\fIslave\fR...? ?\fIoptions\fR...? 
Queries or modifies the configuration options of a slave in a table.  
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for \fIslave\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  \fISlave\fR must be
the pathname of a window already managed by the \fBblt_table\fR.
If \fIoption\fR is specified with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command 
returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  
If one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns the empty string.  
One of more slave windows can be modified (with the 
same options) at the same time.
The following configuration 
options are valid:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-anchor \fIanchorPos\fR
Specifies how the slave window will be arranged if there is extra space 
in the span surrounding the window. \fIAnchorpos\fR may have any of the 
forms accepted by \fBTk_GetAnchor\fR.  For example, if \fIanchorPos\fR is 
\fBcenter\fR then the window is centered in the rows and columns it spans; 
if \fIanchorPos\fR is \fBw\fR then the window will be drawn such it touches
the leftmost edge of the span. This option defaults to \fBcenter\fR.
.TP
\fB\-columnspan \fInumber\fR
Specifies the number of columns spanned by the slave. The default span
is \fB1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-fill \fIstyle\fR
Indicates if the slave should be expanded to occupy any extra space 
in the span.  \fIStyle\fR must be one of the following:
\fBnone\fR, \fBx\fR, \fBy\fR, \fBboth\fR.  If \fIstyle\fR is \fBx\fR,
the width slave window is expanded.  If \fIstyle\fR is \fBy\fR, the
height is expanded. The default is \fBnone\fR.
.TP
\fB\-ipadx \fIpixels\fR
Specifies an extra padding in addition to the width requested by the

The default is \fB0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-reqheight \fIheight\fR
Specifies limits for the requested height of the slave window. These limits 
also constrain the amount of internal padding given to the slave. 
\fIHeight\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the section 
.SB BOUNDING LIST FORMAT
for a description of this list.
By default there are no constraints.
.TP
\fB\-reqwidth \fIwidth\fR
Specifies the limits of the width which a slave may request. These limits 
also affect the amount of internal padding given to the slave.
\fIWidth\fR is a list of bounding values.  See the section 
.SB BOUNDING LIST FORMAT
for a description of this list.
By default there are no constraints.
.TP
\fB\-rowspan \fInumber\fR

\fBblt_table forget \fIslave\fR 
Requests that \fIslave\fR no longer have its geometry managed.
\fISlave\fR is the pathname of the window currently 
managed by some table. The window will be unmapped so that it no longer 
appears on the screen.  If \fIslave\fR is not currently managed by any table, 
an error message is returned, otherwise the empty string.
.TP
\fBblt_table info \fIslave\fR 
Returns a list of the current non-default configuration options of for 
\fIslave\fR.  \fISlave\fR is the pathname of the window currently managed

when the table is resized.
\fIMode\fR must be one of the following:
\fBnone\fR, \fBexpand\fR, \fBshrink\fR, or \fBboth\fR.  If \fImode\fR is 
\fBexpand\fR the height of the row is expanded if there is extra space
in the master window. If \fIstyle\fR is \fBshrink\fR its height may be
reduced beyond its normal height if there is not enough space in the master.
The default is \fBnone\fR.
.RE
.TP
\fBblt_table row \fImaster\fB dimension\fR
Returns the number of rows in the table.
.TP
\fBblt_table row \fImaster\fB info\fI row\fR ?\fIoptions...\fR?
Returns a list of the configuration options for the rows specified.
\fIRowIndex\fR may be in one of two forms; \fBall\fR 
(indicating all rows) or a list of row indices.
The row indices may themselves be numeric expressions.
.TP
\fBblt_table row \fImaster\fB sizes\fI rowIndex\fR
Returns the sizes of the given rows in the table.
\fIRowIndex\fR may be in one of two forms; \fBall\fR

.TP
\fBblt_table slaves \fImaster\fR ?\fIpattern\fR?
Returns a list of pathnames for all slave windows managed by 
\fImaster\fR matching \fIpattern\fR.  If the \fIpattern\fR argument is not
present, then the names of all the slave windows are returned.
\fIMaster\fR is the pathname of a master window.
If \fImaster\fR is not the master window of any table, an error message 
is returned.
.SH BOUNDING LIST FORMAT
Constraints for various options 
(\fB-reqheight\fR, \fB-reqwidth\fR, \fB-height\fR, and \fB-width\fR) are 
specified by supplying a bounding list of values.
Each value must be in a form accepted by \fBTk_GetPixels\fR.
The interpretation of this list is based upon the number of values it
contains:
.RS
.IP "{\fI\fR}"
Empty list. No bounding is performed.
.IP "{\fI x \fR}"
Set the size of the window or partition at \fIx\fR. The size of the partition 
or window cannot grow or shrink.
.IP "{\fI min max \fR}"
Bound the size of the window or partition between \fImin\fR
and \fImax\fR.
.IP "{\fI min max nom\fR}"
Bound the size of the window or partition between \fImin\fR
and \fImax\fR.  In addition, set the normal size to \fInom\fR.
.RE
The maximum bound \fImax\fR can also be specified as \fCInf\fR
to indicate a unlimited maximum bound.  This can be useful when you 
wish only to set the minimum or nominal size of a window or partition.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example arranges a canvas, two scrollbars, and a title
in a frame.
.DS
\f(CWblt_table .frame \\
	.title 0,0 -columnspan 2 -anchor center \\
	.canvas 1,0 -fill both \\
	.vscroll 1,1 -fill y \\
	.hscroll 2,0 -fill x
blt_table column .frame configure 1 -resize none
blt_table row .frame configure 2 -resize none\fR
.DE
.sp 1
The rows and columns containing the scrollbars are frozen at their normal
size, so that even if the frame is resized, the scrollbars will remain
the same width.
.SH BUGS
.VS
There is no warning or error if a window is already a slave or master, 
managed by another geometry manager (there currently is no way to properly 
detect this).  Typically, the window will be repositioned by both geometry 
managers, ad infinitum.  The only recourse is to avoid doing this.
