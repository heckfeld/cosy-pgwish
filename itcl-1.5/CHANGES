 [incr Tcl] - CHANGE LOG
==========================================================================
 ------------------------ RELEASE 1.1 - 7/23/93 -------------------------
==========================================================================

 07/29/93 ... BUG FIX: #auto objects that created other #auto objects
              in their constructor were returing the wrong #auto name.

 07/29/93 ... BUG FIX: "errorInfo" in class interps was causing error
              information to grow without bound, eating huge amounts
              of memory.

 07/30/93 ... BUG FIX: "free-memory-read" during object delete.

 08/06/93 ... BUG FIX: "delete" method now returns error message on error.

 08/06/93 ... BUG FIX: Widget classes in "demos/widgets" now have
              proper destructors, allowing the widgets to be deleted
              and recreated.

 08/20/93 ... Added "virtual" command for accessing most-specific
              class scope.  This provides a cleaner way of invoking
              virtual commands from within a class method than the
              trick "$this method" described previously.

 08/25/93 ... Abandoned notion of using "unknown" proc to intercept calls
              like "class::proc" and invoke them as "class :: proc".
              Removed "init.tcl" from "library" directory, so installation
              no longer fiddles with library files.  As a convenience,
              I have provided a version of "auto_mkindex" that recognizes
              class definitions along with procs, but it is up to the
              user to install or use this code.

 08/25/93 ... Added "itcl_reload" procedures to the "library" directory.
              This procedures can be used during debugging to unload
              and reload class definitions.

 08/29/93 ... BUG FIX: changed a few stray calls to "malloc" to "ckalloc"
              to be consistent with the rest of Tcl/Tk.

 09/09/93 ... Removed commands like "open" from class interps.  Such
              commands create/access common facilities, and should only
              exist in the main interpreter.

 09/09/93 ... Fixed "upvar" and "uplevel" to work across interp
              boundaries.  This means that they should work properly
              even if invoked from within a class method to access
              variables that exist in the main interpreter.

 09/09/93 ... Changed semantics of "::" or unknown command.  Command
              is still sent to global scope, but the local call frame
              is retained.  Thus, "::set globalvar val" is no longer
              a proper way to set a global variable.  This has been
              superceded by "global globalvar; set globalvar val".
              This change will fix many problems people have had
              accessing Expect and TclX commands from within class
              methods.

 09/23/93 ... BUG FIX: changed code calling Tcl_AppendResult() and
              Tcl_AppendElement() to always clear result first via
              Tcl_SetResult().

==========================================================================
 ------------------------ RELEASE 1.2 - 9/23/93 -------------------------
==========================================================================

 10/11/93 ... UPGRADE: made compatible with Tcl7.0

 10/12/93 ... UPGRADE: changed Makefiles to use GNU's "autoconf"

 10/14/93 ... UPGRADE: added support for building shared library

 10/14/93 ... BUG FIX: fixed "#auto" to look for names already in
              use and keep incrementing ID integer until a unique
              name is found.

==========================================================================
 ------------------------ RELEASE 1.3 - 10/15/93 ------------------------
==========================================================================

 10/25/93 ... BUG FIX: fixed ckfree() to check for NULL pointers.

 10/25/93 ... BUG FIX: fixed virtual command to set up scope properly.
              Commands like "virtual set x" (where the command is run
              in a base class and "x" is defined in a derived class)
              should now work properly.

 10/27/93 ... MINOR FIX: changed "extern" to "EXTERN" for better
              integration into C++ applications.

 11/17/93 ... BUG FIX: fixed access to "errorInfo" variable for
              proper traceback of errors.

  3/22/94 ... BUG FIX: fixed error traceback to include errorCode
              information in addition to errorInfo.

          ... BUG FIX: fixed error reporting for public variable
              configuration.  Error messages were coming back as
              empty strings.

  3/23/94 ... CONFIGURATION: fixed "configure" script to handle
              shared libraries better.  Script now checks the machine
              type, and if shared libraries can be built, it asks
              the user if they should be built.

          ... INSTALLATION: added "library/" directory to installation
              procedure.

  3/25/94 ... CONFIGURATION: fixed "configure" script to perform
              a better search for Tcl/Tk library and include files.

==========================================================================
 ------------------------ RELEASE 1.4 -  3/25/94 ------------------------
==========================================================================

   4/4/94 ... DEMOS: fixed "demos/widgets/ListBox" to remove archaic
              notion of "-width expand".  The choice of whether or
              not the window should expand falls on the packing of
              its outermost frame.

   4/7/94 ... BUG FIX: fixed "config" argument processing so that
              inherited methods correctly process arguments in the
              most-specific class scope, and not in the scope where
              the method was defined.

   4/8/94 ... LIBRARY: added "destroy" procedure to replace the usual
              Tk "destroy" command.  The new procedure recognizes
              [incr Tcl] objects as well as Tk windows, and destroys
              whatever the widget is in an appropriate manner.

  4/25/94 ... BUG FIX: fixed handling of formal arguments in methods
              and procs so that public/protected/common variables with
              the same name do not get clobbered.
