NAME
       dp_atclose  -  arrange for commands to be evaluated when a
       file or socket is closed

       dp_atclose sockId option ?cmd?

              The dp_atclose command manages the dp_atclose list,
              a list of callback routines that are evaluated just
              before sockId is actually closed.  This  is  useful
              for  networking  applications,  where  filehandlers
              associated with a socket must  be  deleted  when  a
              socket  is  closed.   The argument option specifies
              the operation to be  performed  on  the  dp_atclose
              list.  The valid options are:


              dp_atclose sockId list

                     Returns  the current dp_atclose list associ-
                     ated with sockId.


              dp_atclose sockId set newList

                     Sets the  dp_atclose  list  associated  with
                     sockId to newList.


              dp_atclose sockId append callback

                     Append callback to the end of the dp_atclose
                     list associated with sockId.


              dp_atclose sockId appendUnique callback

                     Appends  callback  to   the   end   of   the
                     dp_atclose  list  associated  with sockId if
                     it's not already a member of the list.


              dp_atclose sockId prepend callback

                     Inserts  callback  at  the  front   of   the
                     dp_atclose list associated with sockId.


              dp_atclose sockId insert beforeCallback callback

                     Inserts  callback  before  beforeCallback in
                     the dp_atclose list associated with  sockId.
                     If  beforeCallback  is not in the dp_atclose
                     list associated with sockId,  no  action  is
                     taken.
              dp_atclose sockId delete callback

                     Delete  callback  from  the  dp_atclose list
                     associated with sockId. If callback  is  not
                     in   the  dp_atclose  list  associated  with
                     sockId, no action is taken.


              dp_atclose sockId clear

                     Clears the dp_atclose list  associated  with
                     sockId.
