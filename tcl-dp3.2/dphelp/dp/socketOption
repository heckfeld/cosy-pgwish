NAME
       dp_socketOption - Change the options on a socket

       dp_socketOption sockId option ?arg?

              The  dp_socketOption command provides access to the
              setsockopt(2) and getsockopt(2) system  calls.   If
              the  optional arg is provided, the option is set on
              the socket sockId.  Otherwise, the current value of
              option  associated  with  sockId is returned.  Cur-
              rently, 3 socket options can be adjusted:

              dp_socketOption sockId sendBuffer ?bytes?
                     Sets/gets the size of the  send  buffer  for
                     sockId.   The  send  buffer is the number of
                     bytes that can be  buffered  in  the  system
                     before  a  send/recv or read/write call will
                     block.  The default value is machine  depen-
                     dent.


              dp_socketOption sockId recvBuffer ?bytes?
                     Sets/gets the size of the receive buffer for
                     sockId.  The receive buffer is the number of
                     bytes  that  can  be  buffered in the system
                     before data will cease  to  flow  on  a  tcp
                     socket,  or be dropped on a udp socket.  The
                     default value is machine dependent.


              dp_socketOption sockId noblock ?yes|no?
                     Sets/gets the non blocking i/o mode for  the
                     connection  associated  with  sockId.   This
                     option will change the behavior  of  various
                     transmission   routines   as   described  in
                     dp_connect(n).  The default value is "no."


              dp_socketOption sockId autoClose ?yes|no?
                     Sets/gets the autoClose flag for the connec-
                     tion  associated  with sockId.  If the auto-
                     Close  flag  is  "yes",  then   any   errors
                     detected  in transmission will automatically
                     close the file.  This case typically arrives
                     when  the connection is closed unexpectedly.
                     Users can attach callbacks to the closing of
                     the file using the dp_atclose facility.  The
                     default value is "yes."


              dp_socketOption sockId keepAlive ?yes|no?
                     Sets/gets the "Keep Alive" flag for the  tcp
                     connection  associated  with sockId.  If the
                     "Keep Alive" flag is on,  the  system  sends
                     periodic  transmission  of messages on a tcp
                     socket.  Should  the connected   party  fail
                     to respond to these messages, the connection
                     is considered  broken  and  will  be  closed
                     automatically.  The default value is "no."
