NAME
       dp_address - internet address record manipulation

       dp_address option ?arg arg ...?

              The dp_address command provides access to an inter-
              nal  array  of  internet  address  records.   These
              address  records  are  appropriate for use as argu-
              ments to the dp_sendTo and receiveFrom network com-
              munication commands of Tcl-DP (Tcl Distributed Pro-
              gramming).  The argument option specifies the oper-
              ation to be performed.  The valid options are:

              dp_address create host port

                     Creates an internal address record that rep-
                     resents the  given  host  address  and  port
                     internet  information.  Returns an addr han-
                     dle that is appropriate for use as an  argu-
                     ment  to  the  dp_sendTo  and dp_receiveFrom
                     commands and as the  addr  argument  in  the
                     commands  below.   Port  can be specified by
                     number or by service name  (see  services(5)
                     for more information).  If specified by ser-
                     vice name, it must be a UDP service.

              dp_address delete addr

                     Delete  the  previously   created   internal
                     address  record that has the given addr han-
                     dle.

              dp_address info addr

                     Return a list of the form {host port}, which
                     is  the internet information stored with the
                     given addr handle.
