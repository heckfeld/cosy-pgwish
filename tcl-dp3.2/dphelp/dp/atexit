NAME
       dp_atexit  - arrange for commands to be evaluated when the
       process is exited.

       dp_atexit option ?cmd?

              The dp_atexit command manages the dp_atexit list, a
              list  of  callback routines that are evaluated just
              before the tcl+tk application is exited.   This  is
              useful for applications where clean up actions must
              be performed before a process can safely exit.  The
              argument  option specifies the operation to be per-
              formed on the dp_atexit list.   The  valid  options
              are:


              dp_atexit list

                     Returns the current dp_atexit list.


              dp_atexit set newList

                     Sets the dp_atexit list newList.


              dp_atexit append callback

                     Append  callback to the end of the dp_atexit
                     list.


              dp_atexit appendUnique callback

                     Appends callback to the end of the dp_atexit
                     list  if  it's  not  already a member of the
                     list.


              dp_atexit prepend callback

                     Inserts  callback  at  the  front   of   the
                     dp_atexit list.


              dp_atexit insert beforeCallback callback

                     Inserts  callback  before  beforeCallback in
                     the dp_atexit list. If beforeCallback is not
                     in the dp_atexit list, no action is taken.


              dp_atexit delete callback
                     Delete callback from the dp_atexit list.  If
                     callback is not in the  dp_atexit  list,  no
                     action is taken.


              dp_atexit clear

                     Clears the dp_atexit list.
