Edit the Makefile to set the installation directory/ies and type

	make 

(or make install) to perform the installation. It is assumed that the
X11 script mkdirhier is in your search path.

The MenuButton class (used by FileNominator) makes use of a standard
X11 bitmap, menu10, from <root of X tree>/include/X11/bitmaps.
Possible default locations are /usr/include/X11/bitmaps and
/usr/local/X11/include/X11/bitmaps. If these are not appropriate for
your system then modify the "option add" statement at the bottom of
MenuButton.tcl. The bitmap is included in the demo directory so that
wigwam.tcl demo can run even if menu10 is missing from your system.

The software can be tried out prior to installation by adding the lib
subdirectory to auto_path in itcl_wish and entering some of the
examples from the man page in the man subdirectory. Alternatively, cd
to the demo directory and try out the scripts there.

If you want wigwam to support widgets from other libraries, e.g. BLT,
all that should be necessary is to create files in lib (or other
directory that will be added to auto_load path) that are similar to
itcl_button.tcl and run itcl_mkindex in the directory, e.g. for
blt_barchart,

    # kludge to fool itcl_mkindex \
    itcl_class itcl_blt_barchart
    
    ItclClassFromWidget blt_barchart
