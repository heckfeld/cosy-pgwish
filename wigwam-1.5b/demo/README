It is intended that these scripts be executed from within the demo
directory with the class files in ../lib. If the class files are
elsewhere then the location should be communicated via the WIGWAMLIB
environment variable.


wigwam.tcl
    Displays wigwam's sample class implementation files (or any other
    files for that matter, courtesy of a FileNominator). Defines a
    simple class derived from itcl_text for displaying files.

formentry.tcl
    Subclasses FormEntry and demonstrates tabbing amongst peers. 

login.tcl
    Demonstrates combining SecretEntryBindings with EmacsFormEntry to
    construct a login window in which the password is not displayed.

paned.tcl
    Demonstrates the Paned widget.

viewport.tcl
    Shows the scrolling of a canvas via scrollbars or mouse button 2
    by placing an Scanvas inside a Viewport, and demonstrates dynamic
    configuration of the Viewport's scrollbars.


To be continued - maybe.
