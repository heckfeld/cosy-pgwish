       chmod mode filelist
              Set  permissions  of  each of the files in the list
              filelist to mode, where mode is an absolute numeric
              mode   or  symbolic  permissions  as  in  the  UNIX
              chmod(1) command.  To specify a mode as  octal,  it
              should be prefixed with a "0" (e.g. 0622).

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.
