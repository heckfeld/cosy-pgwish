NAME
       send - Execute a command in a different interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       send interp cmd ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This command arranges for cmd (and args) to be executed in
       the interpreter named by interp.  It returns the result or
       error  from  that  command  execution.  Interp must be the
       name of an interpreter registered on the  display  associ-
       ated with the interpreter in which the command is invoked;
       it need not be within the same process or application.  If
       no  arg arguments are present, then the command to be exe-
       cuted is contained entirely within the cmd  argument.   If
       one  or  more  args  are present, they are concatenated to
       form the command to be executed, just as for the eval  Tcl
       command.


SECURITY
       The  send  command is potentially a serious security loop-
       hole, since any application that can  connect  to  your  X
       server  can  send  scripts  to  your  applications.  These
       incoming scripts can use Tcl to read and write your  files
       and  invoke  subprocesses  under  your  name.   Host-based
       access control such as that provided by xhost is  particu-
       larly  insecure, since it allows anyone with an account on
       particular hosts to connect to your server,  and  if  dis-
       abled it allows anyone anywhere to connect to your server.
       In order to provide at least a small amount  of  security,
       Tk  checks the access control being used by the server and
       rejects incoming sends unless (a) xhost-style access  con-
       trol  is  enabled  (i.e.  only certain hosts can establish
       connections) and (b) the list of enabled hosts  is  empty.
       This means that applications cannot connect to your server
       unless they use some other form of authorization  such  as
       that provide by xauth.
