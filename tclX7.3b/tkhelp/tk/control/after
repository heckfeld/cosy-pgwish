NAME
       after - Execute a command after a time delay

SYNOPSIS
       after ms ?arg1 arg2 arg3 ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command is used to delay execution of the program or
       to execute a command in background after a delay.  The  ms
       argument  gives a time in milliseconds.  If ms is the only
       argument to after then the command sleeps for ms millisec-
       onds  and  returns.   While  the  command  is sleeping the
       application does not respond to X events and other events.

       If  additional  arguments are present after ms, then a Tcl
       command is formed  by  concatenating  all  the  additional
       arguments  in  the  same  fashion  as  the concat command.
       After returns immediately but arranges for the command  to
       be executed ms milliseconds later in background.  The com-
       mand will be executed at global level (outside the context
       of any Tcl procedure).  If an error occurs while executing
       the delayed command then the tkerror mechanism is used  to
       report the error.

       The after command always returns an empty string.
