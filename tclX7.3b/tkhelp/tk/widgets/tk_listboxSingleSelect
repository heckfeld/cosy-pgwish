NAME
       tk_listboxSingleSelect  -  Allow only one selected element
       in listbox(es)

SYNOPSIS
       tk_listboxSingleSelect arg ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This command is a Tcl procedure provided as part of the Tk
       script  library.   It takes as arguments the path names of
       one or more listbox widgets, or the  value  Listbox.   For
       each  named  widget,  tk_listboxSingleSelect  modifies the
       bindings of the widget so that only a single  element  may
       be  selected  at  a  time (the normal configuration allows
       multiple elements to be selected).  If the keyword Listbox
       is among the window arguments, then the class bindings for
       listboxes are changed so that all listboxes have the  one-
       selection-at-a-time behavior.
