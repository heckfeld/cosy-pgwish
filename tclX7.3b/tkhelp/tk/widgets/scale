WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           command
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:-command

              Specifies the prefix of a  Tcl  command  to  invoke
              whenever the value of the scale is changed interac-
              tively.  The actual command consists of this option
              followed by a space and a number.  The number indi-
              cates the new value of the scale.

       Name:           from
       Class:          From
       Command-Line Switch:-from

              Specifies the value corresponding to  the  left  or
              top end of the scale.  Must be an integer.

       Name:           label
       Class:          Label
       Command-Line Switch:-label

              Specifies a string to displayed  as a label for the
              scale.  For vertical scales the label is  displayed
              just to the right of the top end of the scale.  For
              horizontal scales the label is displayed just above
              the left end of the scale.

       Name:           length
       Class:          Length
       Command-Line Switch:-length

              Specifies  the  desired long dimension of the scale
              in screen units (i.e. any of the  forms  acceptable
              to  Tk_GetPixels).  For vertical scales this is the
              scale's height;  for horizontal scales  it  is  the
              scale's width.

       Name:           showValue
       Class:          ShowValue
       Command-Line Switch:-showvalue
              Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or not
              the current value of the scale is to be  displayed.

       Name:           sliderForeground
       Class:          sliderForeground
       Command-Line Switch:-sliderforeground

              Specifies  the  color to use for drawing the slider
              under normal conditions.  When the mouse is in  the
              slider window then the slider's color is determined
              by the activeForeground option.

       Name:           sliderLength
       Class:          SliderLength
       Command-Line Switch:-sliderlength

              Specfies the size of the slider, measured in screen
              units along the slider's long dimension.  The value
              may be specified in any of the forms acceptable  to
              Tk_GetPixels.

       Name:           state
       Class:          State
       Command-Line Switch:-state

              Specifies  one of two states for the scale:  normal
              or disabled.  If the scale  is  disabled  then  the
              value  may not be changed and the scale won't acti-
              vate when the mouse enters it.

       Name:           tickInterval
       Class:          TickInterval
       Command-Line Switch:-tickinterval

              Must be an integer value.  Determines  the  spacing
              between  numerical tick-marks displayed below or to
              the left of the slider.  If specified as 0, then no
              tick-marks will be displayed.

       Name:           to
       Class:          To
       Command-Line Switch:-to

              Specifies  the  value corresponding to the right or
              bottom end of the scale.  Must be an integer.  This
              value  may  be either less than or greater than the
              from option.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:-width

              Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the scale
              in  screen  units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable
              to Tk_GetPixels).  For vertical scales this is  the
              scale's  width;   for horizontal scales this is the
              scale's height.


DESCRIPTION
       The scale command creates a new window (given by the path-
       Name  argument)  and  makes it into a scale widget.  Addi-
       tional options, described above, may be specified  on  the
       command  line  or  in  the  option  database  to configure
       aspects of the scale such as its colors, orientation,  and
       relief.   The scale command returns its pathName argument.
       At the time this command is invoked, there must not  exist
       a window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.

       A scale is a widget that displays a rectangular region and
       a  small  slider.  The rectangular region corresponds to a
       range of integer values (determined by  the  from  and  to
       options), and the position of the slider selects a partic-
       ular integer value.  The slider's position (and hence  the
       scale's  value)  may  be  adjusted by clicking or dragging
       with the mouse as described in the BINDINGS section below.
       Whenever  the  scale's  value is changed, a Tcl command is
       invoked (using the command option) to notify other  inter-
       ested widgets of the change.

       Three  annotations  may be displayed in a scale widget:  a
       label appearing at the top-left of the  widget  (top-right
       for  vertical  scales), a number displayed just underneath
       the slider (just to the left of the  slider  for  vertical
       scales),  and  a  collection  of numerical tick-marks just
       underneath the current value (just to the left of the cur-
       rent  value  for  vertical  scales).   Each of these three
       annotations may be selectively enabled or  disabled  using
       the configuration options.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The  scale command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may  be  used  to  invoke  various
       operations  on  the  widget.  It has the following general
       form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact  behavior  of  the
       command.   The  following  commands are possible for scale
       widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path-
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the values accepted by the scale command.

       pathName get
              Returns  a  decimal string giving the current value
              of the scale.

       pathName set value
              This command is invoked to change the current value
              of  the  scale, and hence the position at which the
              slider is displayed.  Value gives the new value for
              the scale.


BINDINGS
       When  a  new  scale  is created, it is given the following
       initial behavior by default:

       <Enter>             Change  the  slider  display  to   use
                           activeForeground  instead  of  slider-
                           Foreground.

       <Leave>             Reset the slider display to use  slid-
                           erForeground  instead  of  activeFore-
                           ground.

       <ButtonPress-1>     Change the slider display so that  the
                           slider   appears  sunken  rather  than
                           raised.  Move the slider  (and  adjust
                           the  scale's  value)  to correspond to
                           the current mouse position.

       <Button1-Motion>    Move  the  slider  (and   adjust   the
                           scale's  value)  to  correspond to the
                           current mouse position.

       <ButtonRelease-1>   Reset the slider display so  that  the
                           slider appears raised again.
