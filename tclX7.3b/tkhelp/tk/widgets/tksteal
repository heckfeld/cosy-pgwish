       dard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           command
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:           -command

              Specifies the executable that is called.  The  com-
              mand usually calls the program with a special name,
              so that tksteal can wait for the appearance of this
              window  (specified with -name and referenced by the
              $name variable). There are several  variables  that
              can  be  specified  in  the  command. The variables
              width and height are replaced by the specified wid-
              get  size. The variables windowid and stealwindowid
              are expanded to the passed window id (-windowid) or
              the  window  id of the tksteal widget. The standard
              resources are referred to  by  their  corresponding
              variable name (e.g. $background).

       Name:           name
       Class:          Name
       Command-Line Switch:           -name

              Specifies  the  name of the window that will appear
              on the screen. This name is used to select the win-
              dow for reparenting.

       Name:           stealWindowId
       Class:          WindowId
       Command-Line Switch:           -stealwindowid

              Specifies the window id of the tksteal widget. This
              window id is used as the parent for reparenting.

       Name:           windowId
       Class:          WindowId
       Command-Line Switch:           -windowid

              Specifies the window id of  the  embedded  applica-
              tion. This window id is reparented.
DESCRIPTION
       The  tksteal  command  creates  a new window (given by the
       pathName argument) and makes it  into  a  tksteal  widget.
       Additional  options,  as described above, may be specified
       on the command line or in the option database to configure
       aspects  of  the  tksteal  such  as its default background
       color and relief.  The tksteal command  returns  the  path
       name of the new window.

       A  tksteal  widget  displays  a  reparented window from an
       external X application. This widget may serve as a  proto-
       type for the user's own developments in this area.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The  tksteal command creates a new Tcl command the name of
       which is the same as the path name of the  tksteal's  win-
       dow. This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget. It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       PathName is the name of the command. It is the same as the
       tksteal  widget's path name. Option and the args determine
       the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands
       are possible for tksteal widgets:

       pathName buttonclick button ?modifier?
              This  command  sends  a  button click (ButtonDown +
              ButtonUp) to the embedded  application.  The  first
              parameter  specifies  which  button is clicked, and
              the optional second parameter specifies  the  Modi-
              fier.

       pathName buttonpress button ?modifier?
              This  command  sends a button press to the embedded
              application. The first  parameter  specifies  which
              button  is pressed, and the optional second parame-
              ter specifies the Modifier.

       pathName buttonrelease button ?modifier?
              This command sends a button release to the embedded
              application.  The  first  parameter specifies which
              button is released, and the optional second parame-
              ter specifies the Modifier.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Queries  or  modifies  the configuration options of
              the widget.  If no option is specified,  returns  a
              list  describing all available options for pathName
              (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format
              of  this  list).   If  option  is specified with no
              value, the command returns a  list  describing  the
              one  named "option" (this list will be identical to
              the corresponding sublist of the value returned  if
              no   option   is   specified).    If  one  or  more
              option-value pairs are specified, the command modi-
              fies  the  given widget option(s) to have the given
              value(s); in this  case,  the  command  returns  an
              empty  string.   Option  may have any of the values
              accepted by the tksteal command.

       pathName keyclick keysym ?modifier?
              This command sends a key click (KeyDown + KeyUp) to
              the embedded application. The first parameter spec-
              ifies which key is clicked, and the optional second
              parameter specifies the Modifier. The keysym can be
              every keysym specified in <X11/keysymdef.h>.

       pathName keypress keysym ?modifier?
              This command sends a  key  press  to  the  embedded
              application.   The  first parameter specifies which
              key is pressed, and the optional  second  parameter
              specifies  the  Modifier.  The  keysym can be every
              keysym specified in <X11/keysymdef.h>.

       pathName keyrelease keysym ?modifier?
              This command sends a key release  to  the  embedded
              application.  The  first  parameter specifies which
              key is released, and the optional second  parameter
              specifies  the  Modifier.  The  keysym can be every
              keysym specified in <X11/keysymdef.h>.

       pathName sendstring string ?interval?
              This command sends a complete string to the  embed-
              ded  application. The string can contain a standard
              character (e.g. "abCDde+-?"), modifiers enclosed in
              <> (e.g. "ab<Control>n") , keysyms also enclosed in
              <> (e.g. "ab<Enter>") , and  the  special  modifier
              extensions  "Press"  and "Release" (e.g. "ab<Press-
              Shift>aaa<Release-Shift>").  The  escape  sequences
              '\t'  (for tabulator), '\r' (for return), '\n' (for
              return),  and  '\b'  (for   backspace)   are   also
              accepted.  The  optional interval value can be used
              to add a delay to the keypress events  (to  emulate
              some kind of user speed typing). The value is given
              in seconds.

       pathName motion x y
              This command places the mouse pointer to the speci-
              fied position.

       pathName redisplay
              This command redisplays the widget.

       pathName stoptksteal
              This  command  terminates the running embedded pro-
              cess.
BINDINGS
       The tksteal widget does not allow special  bindings.  This
       is because reparenting is used which means that the events
       are passed directly to the child widget.


IMPLEMENTATION
       I tried to keep the changes to Tk as  small  as  possible.
       The  changes  to  Tk  only add one new command to Tk (xac-
       cess(n)). If you don't use the new command, you  will  not
       notice   any   changes  compared  to  the  standard  wish.
       Ghostscript is not modified.


PERFORMANCE ISSUES
       Performance is a critical point with the  tksteal  widget.
       Each  created  widget  has a complete process . This means
       you should be careful with the number of widgets.


BUGS
       o      Surely, there are many bugs.
