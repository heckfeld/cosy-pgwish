STANDARD OPTIONS

       See  the ``options'' manual entry for details on the stan-
       dard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -height

              Specifies a desired height for  the  label.   If  a
              bitmap  is  being  displayed  in the label then the
              value is in screen units (i.e.  any  of  the  forms
              acceptable  to  Tk_GetPixels);  for  text  it is in
              lines of text.  If this option isn't specified, the
              label's desired height is computed from the size of
              the bitmap or text being displayed in it.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -width

              Specifies a desired width  for  the  label.   If  a
              bitmap  is  being  displayed  in the label then the
              value is in screen units (i.e.  any  of  the  forms
              acceptable  to  Tk_GetPixels);  for  text  it is in
              characters.  If this option  isn't  specified,  the
              label's  desired width is computed from the size of
              the bitmap or text being displayed in it.


DESCRIPTION
       The label command creates a new window (given by the path-
       Name  argument)  and  makes it into a label widget.  Addi-
       tional options, described above, may be specified  on  the
       command  line  or  in  the  option  database  to configure
       aspects of the label such as its colors, font,  text,  and
       initial  relief.   The  label command returns its pathName
       argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must
       not  exist  a window named pathName, but pathName's parent
       must exist.

       A label is a widget that  displays  a  textual  string  or
       bitmap.   The  label  can  be  manipulated in a few simple
       ways, such as changing  its  relief  or  text,  using  the
       commands described below.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The  label command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may  be  used  to  invoke  various
       operations  on  the  widget.  It has the following general
       form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact  behavior  of  the
       command.   The  following  commands are possible for label
       widgets:

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration  options  of  the
              widget.   If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing all of the available options  for  path-
              Name  (see  Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified  with
              no  value, then the command returns a list describ-
              ing the one named option (this list will be identi-
              cal  to  the  corresponding  sublist  of  the value
              returned if no option is  specified).   If  one  or
              more  option-value  pairs  are  specified, then the
              command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
              the  given  value(s);   in  this  case  the command
              returns an empty string.  Option may  have  any  of
              the values accepted by the label command.


BINDINGS
       When a new label is created, it has no default event bind-
       ings: labels are not intended to be interactive.
